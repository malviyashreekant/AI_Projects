    Calculate the final price of an item after applying customer tier and bulk discounts.
    
    This function applies two types of discounts:
    1. Customer tier discount: Based on the customer's loyalty status (gold, silver, bronze)
    2. Bulk discount: Based on the quantity purchased (1% per unit, capped at 20%)
    
    The total discount is capped at a maximum of 30% to ensure profitability.
    
    Args:
        price (float): The original price of the item before discounts.
            Must be a positive number.
        
        customer_tier (str): The customer's loyalty tier. Determines base discount rate.
            Valid values:
            - "gold": 15% base discount
            - "silver": 10% base discount
            - "bronze": 5% base discount
            - Other values: 0% base discount (no tier discount applied)
        
        quantity (int): The number of items being purchased.
            Must be a non-negative integer.
            Bulk discount is calculated as 1% per unit, maximum 20%.
    
    Returns:
        float: The final price after applying all applicable discounts.
            Returns the discounted price rounded to 2 decimal places.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If price is not a number or quantity is not an integer.
        ValueError: If price is negative or quantity is negative.
    
    Notes:
        - Maximum total discount is capped at 30%
        - Bulk discount is calculated as min(quantity * 0.01, 0.20)
