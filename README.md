# AI Projects Portfolio 🤖

This repository showcases **auto-generated AI projects** created using Claude AI. Each project demonstrates practical, real-world AI use cases with working code.

## About

These projects are automatically generated by a local automation system that:
- Creates self-contained AI applications
- Uses the Anthropic Claude API for real AI functionality
- Runs and validates each project before committing
- Commits successful projects to this repository

## Project Types

Each project solves a specific real-world problem:

- **Email Auto-Responder** - Generates context-aware email responses
- **Product FAQ System** - RAG-based question answering
- **Customer Review Analyzer** - Sentiment and theme extraction
- **Meeting Notes Summarizer** - Structured summaries with action items
- **Content Categorizer** - Multi-label classification
- **Document Q&A Assistant** - Document-based question answering
- **Code Documentation Generator** - Automated code documentation
- **Data Extraction Tool** - Structured data from unstructured text
- **Multi-Step Content Pipeline** - Chained AI operations
- **Intelligent Query Router** - Intent-based query routing

## Project Structure

Each generated project includes:

```
Projects_*/
  ├── README.md           # Project documentation
  ├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies (anthropic SDK)
  ├── run.log            # Execution output
  └── src/
      └── main.py        # Complete working code
```

## Running a Project

```bash
cd Projects_[name]_[timestamp]
python src/main.py
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- Install: `pip install anthropic>=0.40.0`

## Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **AI Model:** Claude (Anthropic)
- **Approach:** Self-contained with embedded sample data
- **Code Size:** 50-150 lines per project

## Notes

- All projects are **fully functional** and ready to run
- Sample data is **embedded** for immediate testing
- Each project uses **real Claude API calls** (not mocks)
- `run.log` shows actual execution output
